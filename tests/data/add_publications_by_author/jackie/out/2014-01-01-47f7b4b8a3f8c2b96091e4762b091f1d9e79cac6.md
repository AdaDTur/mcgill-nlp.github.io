## Abstract

Distributional Semantics for Robust Automatic Summarization Jackie Chi Kit Cheung Doctor of Philosophy Graduate Department of Computer Science University of Toronto 2014 Large text collections are an important resource of information about the world, containing everything from movie reviews and research papers to news articles about current events. Yet the sheer size of such collections presents a challenge for applications to make sense of this data and present it to users. Automatic summarization is one potential solution which aims to shorten one or more source documents while retaining the important information. Summarization is a complex task that requires inferences about the form and content of the summary using a semantic model. This dissertation examines the feasibility of distributional semantics as the core semantic representation for automatic summarization. In distributional semantics, the meanings of words and phrases are modelled by the contexts in which they appear. These models are easy to train and have found successful applications, but they have until recently not been seriously considered as contenders to support semantic inference for complex NLP tasks such as summarization because of a lack of evaluation methods that would demonstrate their benefit. I argue that current automatic summarization systems avoid relying on semantic analysis by focusing instead on replicating the source text to be summarized, but that substantial progress will not be possible without semantic analysis and domain knowledge acquisition. To overcome these problems, I propose an evaluation framework for distributional semantics based on first principles about the role of a semantic formalism in supporting inference. My experiments show that current distributional semantic approaches can support semantic inference at
