## Abstract

Word sketches are one-page automatic, corpus-based summaries of a word’s grammatical and collocational behaviour. These are widely used for studying a language and in lexicography. Sketch Engine is a leading corpus tool which takes as input a corpus and generates word sketches for the words of that language. It also generates a thesaurus and ‘sketch differences’, which specify similarities and differences between near-synonyms. In this paper, we present the functionalities of Sketch Engine for Hindi. We collected HindiWaC, a web crawled corpus for Hindi with 240 million words. We lemmatized, POS tagged the corpus and then loaded it into Sketch Engine.
