1. If you are a CS student, you should submit an application to both [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/msc-supervision-request/) and [McGill Computer Science](http://sivareddy.in/prospective-students.html). If your financial circumstances do not allow you to afford applying to McGill Computer Science, just apply to Mila.
2. If you are linguistics student, submit an application at McGill Linguistics.
3. No need to email me. I will look at your application material along with all other candidates. 

If you don't have any experience in NLP/ML, get admission through Masters (by courses) and then do one of the NLP courses offered at McGill and then reach out to me.
