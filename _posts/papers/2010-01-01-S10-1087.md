## Abstract

We describe two systems that participated in SemEval-2010 task 17 (All-words Word Sense Disambiguation on a Specific Domain) and were ranked in the third and fourth positions in the formal evaluation. Domain adaptation techniques using the background documents released in the task were used to assign ranking scores to the words and their senses. The test data was disambiguated using the Personalized PageRank algorithm which was applied to a graph constructed from the whole of WordNet in which nodes are initialized with ranking scores of words and their senses. In the competition, our systems achieved comparable accuracy of 53.4 and 52.2, which outperforms the most frequent sense baseline (50.5).
